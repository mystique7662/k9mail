## k9mail

This is a mirror/fork of the svn repository at
[code.google.com/p/k9mail/](http://code.google.com/p/k9mail/)

This branch contains a version of k9mail used in the Android SMS backup tool, [SMS Backup+](http://github.com/jberkel/sms-backup-plus). The master branch tracks the upstream repo (but won't necessarily get updated that often).
